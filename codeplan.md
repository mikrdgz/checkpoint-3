#Final Project

## Develop custom checkout with BigCommerce's Checkout SDK
https://www.bigcommerce.com

##The SDK:
https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js

The Checkout JS SDK is a client-side JavaScript library for our Storefront Checkout API. It provides all the methods that are required to complete a checkout process, for example:

Sign in a customer and begin the checkout process
Set shipping, billing and other required information
Pay for the order and complete the checkout process

Using this library in conjunction with your favorite UI framework, it is possible to build a bespoke checkout UI for a store, that can be augmented with additional features. We provide a basic reference implementation of a custom checkout written in React to get you started.

##1. I'd like to create a custom-styled checkout
- This means adding all CSS and form elements
- Must have a seamless experience for the user

##2. Be able to process a payment on my custom checkout app
- I'd like to build it with React and be able to process a payment
- Must successfully take and pass all checkout information to the BigCommerce payment service
- Must show a success message to the customer

##3. Payment processed and visible inside BigCommerce dashboard
- The payment must be visible and processed successfully in the dashboard

I hope to showcase my skills by using this advanced developer tool.
